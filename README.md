# GLM

This repo contains a presentation on Generalized Linear Models.

Summary: In general, linear models are very good explanatory tools for our data. Linear models are used under some assumptions, which can be summarised as linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality. The idea of the generalized linear models arise to expand the normailty assumption to be true for family of exponential distribution. As an example, for a binary dependent variable, the linear model might exceeds the probability of 1, as it is unbounded, but using logistic regression it can be transformed into an S-shaped curve that is bounded correctly. Generalized Linear Model (GLM) is an advanced statistical modelling technique formulated by John Nelder and Robert Wedderburn in 1972. It allows the response variable ùë¶ to have an error distribution other than a normal distribution, but of the exponential family distribution. Its major components are: systematic component (the dependent variable), link function (a function that maps non-linear relationship to a linear one to fit the data), and a random component (distribution function). There are many advantages of using GLM, such as the ability to deal with categorical predictors. It also limited by the fact that it is sensitive to outliers.
